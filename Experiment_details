Original Matterport MaskRCNN implementation:

1) Dataset: shapes
2) Conda env: old_tf in cluster
3) Specification of env:
	- tensorflow version 1.5
	- downgrade numpy to 1.16.4
	- Must have python version >= 3.7
	- Keras version : upgrade from 2.0.8 to 2.1.4
	- If it uses Theano backend, change it to tensorflow backend : In your folder where envs are stored, go to your environment and find the folder etc/conda/activate.d. Go to the file keras_activate.sh and change the back end appropriately.
	- Initialize with coco weights and NOT imagenet weights


Ported Matterport Mask RCNN implementation:

1) Dataset: shapes
2) Conda env in cluster: port_test
3) Sepcification of env:
	- tensorflow 2.1
	- keras: 2.3.1
	- numpy: 1.19.1 (default)
	- python verison >= 3.7.8
	- Initialized with coco weights
